# ◾Who am I
### I am a Software Developer who enjoys watching anime and gaming on my free time. There is nothing more enjoyable to me than sitting down, making a cool application, and getting that adrenaline rush whenever you fix an issue that has stumped you for a while.

# ◾What I provide to a team
### Beyond a happy face I am a flexible coder who is very excited to learn new things, I also have a tendency to pick things up fairly quickly as well as communicate my knowledge effectively with others. On top of that (not to toot my own horn or anything) I am a quite effective time boxer. If something is taking to long, I am not afraid of asking for help or switching gears and coming back to it when I have more time.

# ◾What drives me
### The thing that most motivates me to continue coding and will continue motivating me is the limitless potential of the software development field. As technology progresses onward there is always more to implement and forever more to improve on. I love the idea that whenever I wish there was an app for something that I wanted I can just make it.
